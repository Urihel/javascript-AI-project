# javascript-AI-project
This here is a very design for an AI using HTML, CSS, and JS. The design currently utilizes a button which triggers a prompt message in js and directly to the browser. After you read the message and you reply with "hi" the if statement executes and returns the audio file in my case an m4a audio file because i used my cellphones built in voice recorder to create a voice file and then transfer that file over to my computer to make it all work. As of right now, this is still something brand new to me and something i now working on.
