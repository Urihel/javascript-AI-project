# javascript-AI-project
This here is a very basic design for an AI using HTML, CSS, and JS. The design currently utilizes a custom button which i created an a click API in raw javascript. after your API executes the variable that has the prompt messages stored in will pop up on the window, and you will have the option to reply with "hi" in text form. Insides the click button API, i have an if statement which executes and returns the audio file in my case an m4a audio file along with the variable name and .play(); because i used my cellphones built in voice recorder to create a voice file and then transfer that file over to my computer to make it all work. As of right now, this is still something brand new to me and something i now working on. I hope to add a microphone soon, so instead of typing you can just talk to it.
